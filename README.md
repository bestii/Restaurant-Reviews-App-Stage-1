---

## How to run the Project
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bestii/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage-1.git`.
2. Replace `<ADD_YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY_HERE>` in `js/config.js` with your [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API key.
3. Install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) plugin.
4. Choose the cloned folder to serve and navigate to localhost URL shown in the plugin.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). 
You need to replace `<ADD_YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY_HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
